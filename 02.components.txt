- Some boxes represent system components, double boxes are also in-memory
  data structures

- DML follows the path of the left side. DDL follows the path of the
right side

- transaction processing, two views:
 - AI - concurrency control mechanisms, lock manager, scheduler, 
 - CD - consistency, durability - logging and recovery manager

acid  - coined in 1983 by andreas reuters

atomicity - any transaction or completes, or rollbacks, no part
of transaction is left of the system in case of rollback

A typical example of atomicity failure is in accounting, money transfer:
subtract from one account, add to another account.

e.g.:
 - one part of transaction fails - all fails
 - type of failure: power failure, crash, resource allocation error, bug

consistency - brings database from one valid state to another.
In a relational valid is defined by constraitns, triggers, foreign keys
 consistency is very general, so an example would based on a
 consistency instrument implemented in the database. 

isolation -  principle of serial history, even though the transactions
may execute concurrently, it's possibe to come up with a serial order
of execution for them. 


T1 subtracts 10 from A.
T1 adds 10 to B.
T2 subtracts 10 from B.
T2 adds 10 to A.

 - wikipedia example

durability - once a transaction is committed, it will remain in the database
 - violation: power loss, machine failure, site failiure, bug

 - success message is sent to the client - mongodb
