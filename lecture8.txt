Before we begin
---------------

Don't recover:
    - checkpointing
    - stateless operation

Impossible to recover:
- a notion of idempotent operation and non-idempotent operation:

Types of recovery
-----------------

   printing a check - non-idempotent operation
   repeating a transaction from write ahead log - an idempotent
   operation

   Handling an idempotent operation is a topic for queueing theory.

- taransaction-based recovery: why transactio isolation
is necessary not only for consistency, but also for recoverabiilty
-> follow the demands on the locking model

Interaction of recovery and locking
----------------------------------
- demands on the locking model


Basic recovery algorithms
-------------------------

Shadow paging

Checkpointing
-------------

Quiscent checkpointing
Non-quiscent (fuzzy) checkpointing.
